# Ecommerce-Churn-Analysis
Churn prediction project for an e-commerce platform focused on identifying high-risk customers using transactional and demographic data. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand how variables like number of orders, AOV, complaints raised, tenure, payment mode, and city tier impacted churn. Models were built iteratively—starting with a decision tree and progressing to a Random Forest—to improve performance, achieving 88% recall and 0.99 AUC. Insights from the model enabled targeted retention strategies, informed UX and service improvements, and supported data-driven decision-making for customer lifecycle management.
